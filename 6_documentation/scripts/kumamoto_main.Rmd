## Kumamoto (Strike-Slip) Case

There are two applicable sensitivity cases (i.e., for on-fault (principal) 
faulting): Sensitivity 2 and Sensitivity 3.

Sensitivity 2 uses a full seismic source characterization logic tree with three 
aleatory models for fault segmentation and one epistemic branch that considers 
alternative scenarios for (1) a floating earthquake and (2) a small segment
rupture.

There is no epistemic uncertainty in the seismic source characterization for
Sensitivity 3.
