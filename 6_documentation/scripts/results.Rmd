# Benchmarking Results 

The IAEA Benchmarking cases include all styles of faulting and both on-fault 
(principal or primary ruptures) as well as distributed or secondary ruptures. 
Assessing on-fault (principal) surface-rupture hazards for nuclear installations 
is not generally not necessary because sites known to have such hazards are 
considered unsuitable and excluded in the initial siting evaluations. However, 
as new geologic information becomes available, periodic evaluation of 
distributed or secondary surface-rupture hazards may be necessary for existing 
facilities. It is our understanding that the new TECDOC aims to address this 
aspect by evaluating models and methods for assessing distributed or secondary 
surface-rupture hazard. It is also our understanding that the Benchmarking
cases that consider on-fault (principal) surface-rupture hazard are only 
included to provided additional examples or references for PFDHA calculations

Three Benchmarking cases were provided by the IAEA based on recent 
surface-rupturing earthquakes that produced distributed or secondary ruptures:

1. Reverse faulting, Le Teil case
2. Normal faulting, Norica case
3. Strike-slip faulting, Kumamoto case

In all cases, a base-case seismic source logic tree focused on distributed or 
secondary ruptures was defined by the IAEA and a series of sensitivity tests 
were also provided. In general, the sensitivity tests aimed to capture epistemic 
uncertainty in the base-case seismic source characterization, such as through 
alternative rupture scenarios, rates, or site-to-rupture distances.

As described in **Model Overview**, the KEA24 FDM estimates the *aggregated 
displacement* amplitude. The model does not provide distributed or secondary 
displacements. Therefore, the evaluation presented here is not applicable to any 
of the Benchmarking base-cases and is performed only for the sensitivity cases 
with on-fault (principal) faulting. Additionally, it should be noted that the 
results do not incorporate the conditional probability of principal surface 
rupture unless explicitly given in the logic tree provided by the IAEA.

The sections below present the results of the PFDHAs using the KEA24 FDM. The
model was implemented as recommended in the forthcoming *Earthquake Spectra* 
publication, with key aspects of the implementation summarized above in **Model 
Implementation**. The results are presented in three ways for both the *mean model*
and the *full  model* (which are defined in **Model Implementation**):

1. For the normalized site location in the logic tree; denoted with $U_*$ on the
plots (shown for completeness).

2. For the complement to the normalized site location in the logic tree; denoted 
$1 - U_*$ on the plots (shown for completeness).

3. With equal weighting on both the site and its complementary location 
(recommended hazard curve).

As discussed in **Model Implementation**, the *mean model* is evaluated for
completeness, but we recommend using the *full model* result because it captures
the epistemic uncertainty of the model. Plots comparing the *mean model* and
*full model* results are also provided. Fractiles are included where applicable 
(i.e., where epistemic uncertainty in the seismic source characterization or the 
FDM is included).
