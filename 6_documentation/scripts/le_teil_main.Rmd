## Le Teil (Reverse) Case

The only applicable sensitivity case (i.e., for on-fault (principal) faulting) 
is Sensitivity 2. There is no epistemic uncertainty in the seismic source 
characterization for Sensitivity 2.

As an extra effort, the multi-path logic tree was also evaluated assuming 
on-fault (principal) rupture. This allowed us to evaluate an example with large
epistemic uncertainty in the seismic source characterization.
